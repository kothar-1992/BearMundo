```

## Building

The native code is built using CMake with the following features:

- C++17 standard
- Release build optimization
- Symbol hiding for security
- Stack protection
- Position-independent code
- Function and data section optimization

## Security Features

- Symbol hiding
- Stack protection
- Anti-debugging
- Anti-tampering
- Memory protection
- Code obfuscation

## Development

When adding new native code:

1. Add source files to CMakeLists.txt
2. Follow the existing naming conventions
3. Use proper security practices
4. Test thoroughly before committing
5. Document any security considerations

## Notes

- Keep security measures up to date
- Test on multiple Android versions
- Document any version-specific behavior
- Follow security best practices
