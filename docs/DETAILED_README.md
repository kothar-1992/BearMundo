Bear-Mod is an advanced Android application with native C++ components designed for dynamic instrumentation and security analysis. It provides a powerful framework for analyzing and modifying Android applications at runtime.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Instrumentation**: Modify app behavior at runtime
- **Memory Analysis**: Scan and modify memory regions
- **Root Detection Bypass**: Circumvent common root detection mechanisms
- **SSL Pinning Bypass**: Intercept encrypted network traffic
- **Frida Integration**: Seamless integration with Frida for advanced instrumentation
- **UI Interface**: User-friendly interface for controlling instrumentation
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible for custom analysis needs

## 📋 Requirements

- Android 10.0+ (API level 29+)
- Android NDK 25.1.8937393
- CMake 3.22.1
- JDK 17
- Gradle 8.0+
- C++17 compatible compiler

## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built APK

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/BearOwner/BearProject2023/releases) page
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android settings
3. Install the APK on your device

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BearOwner/BearProject2023.git
   cd BearProject2023
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   # Create local.properties with SDK path
   echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk" > local.properties
   echo "ndk.version=25.1.8937393" >> local.properties
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. Install on your device:
   ```bash
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Launch the Bear-Mod app
2. Grant necessary permissions
3. Select the target application
4. Choose the instrumentation options
5. Apply and monitor the results

### Using with Frida

1. Set up Frida on your device:
   ```bash
   # Push Frida server to device
   adb push frida-tools/server/frida-server-16.1.1-android-arm64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server

   # Set executable permissions
   adb shell chmod +x /data/local/tmp/frida-server

   # Start Frida server
   adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
   ```

2. Run a Frida script:
   ```bash
   # From your PC
   frida -U -n com.example.app -l frida-tools/scripts/bypass-root.js --no-pause
   ```

### Advanced Usage

For advanced usage scenarios, please refer to the [Advanced Usage Guide](docs/guides/advanced-usage.md).

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture to ensure maintainability and extensibility:

- **app/**: Android application code
  - **src/main/cpp/**: Native C++ code
  - **src/main/java/**: Java code
- **frida-tools/**: Frida scripts and tools
- **docs/**: Documentation
- **scripts/**: Build and utility scripts

For a detailed project map, see [PROJECT_MAP.md](PROJECT_MAP.md).

## 🧩 Extension Points

Bear-Mod is designed to be easily extended:

1. **New Frida Scripts**: Add new scripts to `frida-tools/scripts/`
2. **New Hooking Mechanisms**: Extend `app/src/main/cpp/core/hooks/`
3. **New UI Features**: Add new activities/fragments to `app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/ui/`
4. **New Analysis Tools**: Add new tools to `app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/core/analysis/`

## 🔄 Build System

Bear-Mod uses a flexible build system that can adapt to different scenarios:

- **Full Build**: Includes all features and SDK integration
- **Minimal Build**: Core functionality without SDK dependencies
- **Debug Build**: Includes debugging symbols and additional logging

Configure the build by modifying `app/build.gradle` and `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run instrumentation tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
