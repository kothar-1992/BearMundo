# BearSecurity AAR Build Rule

Build the `bearsecurity-release.aar` as a **native C++ Android library** (no UI) for secure integration into container-based loaders.

## Key Requirements

- **JNI Bridge:**  
  Expose `Java_com_happy_pro_KeyAuthBridge_authenticate` for KeyAuth v1.3 C++ SDK.
  Ensure this is the only Java interface exposed.

- **NDK Settings:**  
  - Use Android NDK r25b  
  - Supported ABIs: `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86`, `x86_64`

- **C++ Native Code:**  
  - No usage of `curl`, `libssl`, or OpenSSL
  - Must statically link against KeyAuth C++ SDK only
  - JNI exceptions must log via `__android_log_print`

- **CMake/Gradle Integration:**  
  - Use CMakeLists.txt under `app/src/main/cpp/`
  - No application ID or activity should exist
  - No `res/`, `drawable/`, or layout resources needed

- **Output Artifact:**  
  The final output must be:  
  `build/outputs/aar/bearsecurity-release.aar`

## Build Notes

This AAR will be consumed by:
- `BearMod-Loader`
- `Bear-Container`
- `Frida container patch toolset`

It must remain **small, secure, headless**, and **reusable** across all loader flavors.
