# Project Construction Broadcasting Guidelines

## Build Status Broadcasting
- Implement build status notifications for all major build stages
- Use clear, consistent status messages
- Include build duration and memory usage metrics
- Broadcast errors with detailed context and stack traces

## Progress Reporting
- Show real-time progress for long-running operations
- Display percentage completion for build steps
- Indicate current operation and next steps
- Provide estimated time remaining when possible

## Error Handling
- Broadcast critical errors immediately
- Include error codes and descriptions
- Provide actionable error messages
- Log full error context for debugging

## Performance Metrics
- Report build time for each major component
- Track memory usage during build
- Monitor CPU utilization
- Log resource-intensive operations

## Notification Channels
- Console output for immediate feedback
- Log files for detailed history
- Status files for build tools
- Progress indicators for UI integration

## Best Practices
- Use consistent message formatting
- Implement proper log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Include timestamps in all broadcasts
- Maintain backward compatibility in message formats

## Integration Guidelines
- Support multiple output formats (text, JSON, XML)
- Enable/disable specific broadcast channels
- Allow filtering of broadcast messages
- Provide hooks for custom broadcast handlers
